# About Version Control
The Version Control package provides an in-editor interface for teams to work with Collaborate and Plastic SCM (coming soon).
## Collaborate
Collaborate makes it easy for teams to save, share, and sync their Unity projects with others, regardless of location. It is cloud enabled and built directly into Unity. Please refer to the online documentation for Unity Collaborate [here.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityCollaborate.html)
## Plastic SCM
Plastic SCM Plugin for Unity (beta) is a free Unity plugin that gives you the ability to use Plastic SCM, a leading version control solution, directly in Unity. It is currently available on the Unity Asset Store but will be moving to this package in an upcoming release.
