## [4.0.7] - 2021-07-01

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where object from deleted asset got reused, when upgrading setting asset

## [4.0.6] - 2021-05-18
### Fixes
* Fix issue where XR was not being started when entering play mode if the settings UI was never displayed.
* Fixed an issue where custom XR packages would not get registered when running the Unity Editor using the [-batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html) argument.

### Added

* Added additional documentation explaining that manual XR Initialization should only be called from [Start](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Start.html) or later as calling it from [Awake](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) or [OnEnable](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnEnable.html) can cause issues if graphics initialization hasn't finished yet.

## [4.0.5] - 2021-05-06
### Fixes
* Fix issue with changelog.

## [4.0.4] - 2021-05-04
### Fixes
* Fix issue with analytics on some platforms.

## [4.0.3] - 2021-04-22
### Fixes
* Minor fix to deprecation messaging for Windows Mixed Reality.

## [4.0.2] - 2021-04-16

### Fixes
* When using `XRLoaderHelper`, Subsystems are now correctly removed from the cached subsystems map once they are destroyed.
* Fixed an issue where a `NullReferenceException` could be thrown if a Package Manager query failed but returned completed when updating known packages.
* Fixed an issue where `Plug-in Provider` user interface documentation link redirected to an old version of the documentation.
* Fixed an issue where `TryAddLoader` could ignore the safety checks when modifying the registered loaders in the editor during playmode.
* Fixed an issue where `TryRemoveLoader` could remove a registered loader even if the loader is still in the list of `currentLoaders`.

### Changes
* Add `Open XR` to the list of known plug-in providers when on Unity version 2020.3 and above.
* Added additional safety checks to the behaviour of `TryAddLoader` and `TryRemoveLoader` in the editor. Both now user `EditorApplication.isPlaying` instead of `Application.IsPlaying` when determining whether the editor is in play mode.

## [4.0.1] - 2021-01-22
* Changed `activeLoaders` to instead of returning a shallow copy, it will now just return a read only list to prevent additional garbage collection.
* Changed the behavior of `TryRemoveLoader` to return `true` if the loader is no longer present in the list even if it wasn't present to begin with.

## [4.0.0] - 2021-01-21
* Added API for surfacing package information notification icons in the XR Plug-in Management editor window.
* Fix issue that enabled users to ask for loaders to be assigned/removed during Play mode.
* Update dependency on `com.unity.xr.legacyinputhelpers` to version `2.1.7`.
* Fix issue where the internal list of loaders could modified at runtime in an invalid way. Now, the list of loaders returns a shallow copy of the list at runtime and any modifications using the new `TryAddLoader`, `TryRemoveLoader`, and `TrySetLoaders` methods will be validated to ensure the incoming modifications are legal modifications for the internal loader list before applying them.
* Fix issue where `XRGeneralSettings` would be included in a build when it held no loaders.
* Fix issue involving attempts to modify the loader list while in play mode. That should no longer be actionable and should report an error on attempt.

* Fix FB 1206103: Serialized loader list is not saved correctly when a new loader asset is created as part of the add operation.
* Fix package checking system to also look at installed packages and not just remotely registered packages. This allows us to see packages the user has locally installed on disk that may not be registered in the package registry.
* Add check to make sure we pick up any class in the project that derives from XRLoader and not just those in packages. This allows a developer to create a loader in their assets folder and use that regardless of installed packages.

* Documentation updated to cover the above.
* Fixed a bug in the new Readme script code that caused a crash in headless mode. Seems the code was launching an Editor window and causing UIElements to crash on an attempt to repaint. We have a workaround to make sure we don't load the window if in headless mode and a bug is filed with the responsible team to correct the crash.

## [0.1.0-preview.6] - 2018-07-17

### Added runtime tests for XRManager

### Updated code to reflect name changes for XR Subsystem types.

## [0.1.0-preview.5] - 2018-07-17

### Simplified settings for build/runtime

Since we are 2018.3 and later only we can take advantage of the new PlayerSettings Preloaded Assets API. This API allows us to stash assets in PLayerSettings that are preloaded at runtime. Now, instead of figuring out where to write a file for which build target we just use the standard Unity engine and code access to get the settings we need when we need them.

## [0.1.0-preview.4] - 2018-07-17

### Added samples and ability to load settings

This change adds a full fledged sample base that shows how to work with XR Management from start to finish, across run and build. This includes serializing and de-serializing the settings.

## [0.1.0-preview.3] - 2018-07-17


## [0.1.0-preview.2] - 2018-06-22

### Update build settings management

Changed XRBuildData from a class to an attribute. This allows providers to use simpler SO classes for build data and not foreach them to subclass anything.
Added a SettingsProvider subclass that wraps each of these attribute tagged classes. We use the display name from the attribute to populate the path in Unified Settings. The key in the attribute is used to store a single instance of the build settings SO in EditorBuildSettings as a single point to manage the instance.
Added code to auto create the first SO settings instance using a file panel since the Editor build settings container requires stored instances be backed in the Asset DB. There is no UI for creating the settings (unless added by the Provider) so this should allow us to maintain the singleton settings. Even if a user duplicates the settings instance, since it won't be in the Editor build settings container we won't honor it.

## [0.1.0-preview.1] - 2018-06-21

### This is the first release of *Unity Package XR Management*.
